- **External table** (External Table on Serverless SQL Pool in Azure Synapse Analytics - for Ad hoc and One time analysis) <br>
Federated queries let you read data from external sources while streaming supports continuous data updates


# Optimize BigQuery
- Leverage caching and materialized veiws <br>
- Partition and cluster your BigQuery tables <br>
- Data retention policies <br>
- Avoid duplicate storage - use federated data access <br>

- You can export the result with complicated queries to a table as Destination.
